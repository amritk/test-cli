## `Planets`

Everything about planets

### Get all planets

It's easy to say you know them all, but do you really? Retrieve all the planets and check whether you missed one.

```sh
testing12 planets list --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH" --limit '10' --offset '0'
```

### Create a planet

Time to play god and create a new planet. What do you think? Ah, don't think too much. What could go wrong anyway?

```sh
testing12 planets create --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH" --name 'Mars' --type 'terrestrial'
```

### Get a planet

You'll better learn a little bit more about the planets. It might come in handy once space travel is available for everyone.

```sh
testing12 planets retrieve '1' --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH"
```

### Update a planet

Sometimes you make mistakes, that's fine. No worries, you can update all planets.

```sh
testing12 planets update '1' --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH" --name 'Mars' --type 'terrestrial'
```

### Delete a planet

This endpoint was used to delete planets. Unfortunately, that caused a lot of trouble for planets with life. So, this endpoint is now deprecated and should not be used anymore.

```sh
testing12 planets delete '1' --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH"
```

### Upload an image to a planet

Got a crazy good photo of a planet? Share it with the world!

```sh
testing12 planets upload-image '1' --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH"
```

## `CelestialBodies`

Celestial bodies are the planets and satellites in the Scalar Galaxy.

### Create a celestial body

```sh
testing12 celestial-bodies create --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH"
```

## `Authentication`

Some endpoints are public, but some require authentication. We provide all the required endpoints to create an account and authorize yourself.

### Create a user

Time to create a user account, eh?

```sh
testing12 authentication create-user --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH" --name 'Marc' --email 'marc@scalar.com' --password 'i-love-scalar'
```

### Get a token

Yeah, this is the boring security stuff. Just get your super secret token and move on.

```sh
testing12 authentication create-token --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH" --email 'marc@scalar.com' --password 'i-love-scalar'
```

### Get authenticated user

Find yourself they say. That's what you can do here.

```sh
testing12 authentication list-me --bearer-auth "$BEARER_AUTH"
```
